GUI jumpcutter with FFMPEG. Analysis audio file for silent parts cuts it out and concatinates parts of audio + video in sync. Thus making lecture videos shorter.

Another way to improve or create fork of this project instead of cutting off silent parts, it could do 2x-10x to save some video information. To keep track
